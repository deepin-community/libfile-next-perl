Description: file-finding iterator
 File::Next is an iterator-based module for finding files.  It's
 lightweight, has no dependencies, runs under taint mode, and puts your
 program more directly in control of file selection.
 .
 It's taken heavily from Mark Jason Dominus' excellent book "Higher
 Order Perl".  http://hop.perl.plover.com/
